# Building a Demand Forecating Model
It's simple to buy any product with a click and have it delivered to your door. Online shopping has been rapidly evolving over the last few years, making our lives easier. But behind the scenes, e-commerce companies face a complex challenge that needs to be addressed.

Uncertainty plays a big role in how the supply chains plan and organize their operations to ensure that the products are delivered on time. These uncertainties can lead to challenges such as stockouts, delayed deliveries, and increased operational costs.

I work for the Sales & Operations Planning (S&OP) team at a multinational e-commerce company. They need my help to assist in planning for the upcoming end-of-the-year sales. They want to use my insights to plan for promotional opportunities and manage their inventory. This effort is to ensure they have the right products in stock when needed and ensure their customers are satisfied with the prompt delivery to their doorstep.
I build a model for Predicting e-commerce product demand using PySpark to answer business questions regarding supply chain efficiency.
